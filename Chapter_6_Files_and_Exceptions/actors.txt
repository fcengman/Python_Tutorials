rabbit
the White Rabbit
He is a very distinguished rabbit, always wearing gloves, a waistcoat, and a pocketwatch.
"I'm late! I'm late!" Exclaims the rabbit, "And my watch is broken. I'll never make it on time with my watch in this condition. Bring me the four missing pieces of my watch, the minute hand, the balance screw, the crown wheel, and the winding spring. Then I will take you home. I know I left at least once piece at my cottage."

A caterpillar. Sitting on a mushroom...and smoking a pipe.
"There is nothing remarkable in that," said the caterpillar. "Caterpillars often relax on mushrooms. Did you come from the rabbit's cottage? I will now blow the vowels. A-E-I-O-U."
